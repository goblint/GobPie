# Abstract Debugging with GobPie demo (DEBT'24)

This folder contains the materials for the demo presentation of Abstract Debugging
with GobPie at the [Second Workshop on Future Debugging Techniques (DEBT'24)](https://conf.researchr.org/details/issta-ecoop-2024/debt-2024-papers/4/Abstract-Debugging-with-GobPie).

### :movie_camera:

There is a pre-recorded [video](https://youtu.be/KtLFdxMAdD8) of using the abstract debugger on the source code of SMTP Relay Checker, showcasing how to debug and fix a data race warning using the abstract debugger.

### Examples

The directory contains the following example programs:

1. The [example program](./paper-example/example.c) illustrated in the paper.
2. An [extracted version](./smtprc-example) of the Smtp Open Relay Checker ([smtprc](https://sourceforge.net/projects/smtprc/files/smtprc/smtprc-2.0.3/)).
   Some parts of the code in this project were omitted to speed up the analysis for demonstration purposes.

Some illustrative example programs for demonstrating the abstract debugger's behavior <br>

- with [context-sensitive](context-sensitivity.c) analysis results;
- with [path-sensitive](path-sensitivity.c) analysis results;
- in case of function calls through [function pointers](fun-pointers.c).
